   Welcome to the message encryption program using a one-time cipherblock, which is based on the Vigener cipher.
A one-time cipherblock has absolute cryptographic strength due to the fact that the message is encrypted with
a key that has the same length as the initial message. This allows you to securely encrypt a message, because
without a key, one encrypted message can be decrypted into absolutely any one.
